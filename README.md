# Kahoot Keyboard Shortcuts
A nifty way to play kahoot without moving your hands.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is via the [Firefox Addons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kahoot-keyboard-shortcuts/).

If you want to install from source, just clone the git repo, and add the extension as a temporary addon. Information on how to do this [can be found on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Temporary_Installation_in_Firefox).

## Usage
By default, the shortcuts are mapped to

* Triangle/Red: O
* Diamond/Blue: P
* Circle/Yellow: S
* Square/Green: D

To change these settings, go to `about:addons` and hit the preferences button for "Kahoot Keyboard Shortcuts"

Once finished updated the shortcuts, hit save, and the new shortcuts will instantly be used.
